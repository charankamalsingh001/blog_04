            <h2>Automation Doesn't Just Create or Destroy Jobs — It Transforms Them</h2>

            <p>These days, automation is ubiquitous. While economists frequently discuss whether automation generates or eliminates employment, they pay less attention to how tasks are changed and the wages provided to the workers who perform them. Automation occasionally results in higher-paying jobs, but more frequently it lowers wages. This may seem advantageous for businesses thinking about automating because lower labour costs can boost profits. </p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad technology that is completely changing every aspect of human life. It allows individuals to reconsider how we combine information, evaluate data, and apply the insights that come from this process to make better decisions. In this paper, John Allen and Darrell West address concerns related to AI development, explore its applications in a range of industries, and provide suggestions for maximizing AI's potential while upholding fundamental human values.</p>

            <h2>When Machine Learning Goes Off the Rails</h2>

            <p>Machine learning-based products and services—computer algorithms that continuously take in new data and modify their conclusions in response—don't necessarily produce morally or accurately informed recommendations. For example, they can result in biased employment practices, investment losses, or auto accidents. Furthermore, as these products spread throughout marketplaces, the businesses that produce them take on significant additional risks. Executives must recognize and address any possible drawbacks with the technology.There are several ways in which machine learning might go wrong. Errors are always possible because the systems rely on probability to make decisions. Unexpected changes to their surroundings could cause gaps between the data they are now fed and the data they were trained on. Furthermore, it may be challenging to ascertain whether or not they erred due to their complexity..</p>
